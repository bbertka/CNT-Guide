  ```

### 2. `tasklist`

- **Description**: Windows equivalent of `ps` for listing running tasks and processes.
- **Example Output**:
  ```
  Image Name    PID   Session Name   Mem Usage
  explorer.exe  123   Console        10,000K
  notepad.exe   456   Console        5,000K
  ```

### 3. `netstat` (Network Statistics)

- **Description**: Shows network-related information, including active network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
- **Example Output**:
