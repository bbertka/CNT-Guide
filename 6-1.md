# Networking Basics: IP / Subnetting and CIDR

**IP Address (IPv4):**

- **Definition**: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

- **Format**: IPv4 addresses are typically expressed in four decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1).

- **Example**: 
  - IP Address: 192.168.0.1

**Subnetting**:

- **Definition**: Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger IP network into smaller subnetworks (subnets) to improve network management, security, and efficiency.

- **Subnet Mask**: A subnet mask is used to identify the network portion and the host portion of an IP address. It uses a binary mask of 1s and 0s.

- **Example**:
  - IP Address: 192.168.0.1
  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (or in binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000)

**CIDR Notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):**

- **Definition**: CIDR notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated routing prefix. It's expressed as IP_address/prefix_length (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24).

- **Explanation**: In CIDR notation, the IP address is followed by a forward slash (/) and a prefix length, which indicates the number of bits set in the subnet mask. CIDR notation allows for flexible allocation of IP addresses and subnets.

- **Example**:
  - IP Address: 192.168.0.0
  - Prefix Length: 24 (equivalent to a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0)

**How to Compute CIDR Blocks**:

To compute CIDR blocks, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Range of IP Addresses You Need**: Decide how many IP addresses you need for your network or subnet.

2. **Count the Number of Host Addresses**: Calculate the number of host addresses required. Remember that two addresses in each subnet are reserved for the network address and broadcast address, so subtract 2 from the total.

3. **Find the Appropriate Prefix Length**: Choose a prefix length (subnet mask) that accommodates the required number of host addresses. The formula is: \(2^{\text{32 - prefix\_length}}\) host addresses.

4. **Convert the Prefix Length to CIDR Notation**: Represent the prefix length in CIDR notation (e.g., /24).

5. **Allocate IP Addresses**: Allocate IP addresses within the range of the CIDR block, starting from the first available host address.

**CIDR Block Examples for Network Administrators**:

1. **/24 CIDR Block (Original Example)**:
   - IP Address: 192.168.0.0
   - Prefix Length: 24
   - Range: 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254 (256 host addresses)
   - Explanation: A common choice for home or small office networks.

2. **/16 CIDR Block**:
   - IP Address: 10.0.0.0
   - Prefix Length: 16
   - Range: 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.255.254 (65,536 host addresses)
   - Explanation: Suitable for large corporate networks with multiple subnets.

3. **/28 CIDR Block**:
   - IP Address: 172.16.0.0
   - Prefix Length: 28
   - Range: 172.16.0.1 to 172.16.0.14 (14 host addresses)
   - Explanation: Often used for VLANs or isolated network segments.

4. **/30 CIDR Block**:
   - IP Address: 203.0.113.0
   - Prefix Length: 30
   - Range: 203.0.113.1 to 203.0.113.2 (2 host addresses)
   - Explanation: Suitable for point-to-point connections.

5. **/22 CIDR Block**:
   - IP Address: 192.168.16.0
   - Prefix Length: 22
   - Range: 192.168.16.1 to 192.168.19.254 (1,024 host addresses)
   - Explanation: Used in larger networks with multiple subnets.

Understanding CIDR notation and how to compute CIDR blocks is crucial for network administrators as it allows for efficient IP address allocation and subnetting, enabling the design and management of complex networks with ease.
