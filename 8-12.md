# Creating and Changing Registry Values via Command Line or GUI

The Windows Registry is a crucial part of the Windows operating system, storing configuration settings and options for both the OS and installed applications. You can create and modify registry values using either the command line or graphical user interface (GUI) tools. This guide covers both methods.

## Via Graphical User Interface (GUI)

### 1. Using the Registry Editor (Regedit)

1. **Open the Registry Editor**:
   - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `regedit` and press Enter.

2. **Navigate to the Desired Key**:
   - Use the left pane to navigate through the registry's hierarchical structure.
   - Click on a key to select it.

3. **Create a New Key or Value**:
   - To create a new key, right-click on the parent key, select "New," and choose "Key." Give it a name.
   - To create a new value, right-click on the right pane, select "New," and choose the value type (e.g., String, DWORD). Name it and enter the value data.

4. **Modify an Existing Value**:
   - Double-click on an existing value to modify it.
   - Enter the new data and click "OK."

5. **Delete a Key or Value**:
   - Right-click on the key or value and select "Delete."

6. **Backup and Restore**:
   - To back up a key, select it and go to "File" > "Export." Save the .reg file.
   - To restore, double-click the .reg file or use "File" > "Import."

## Via Command Line

### 1. Using the `Reg` Command

1. **Open a Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

2. **Syntax for Creating a New Key**:
   ```powershell
   reg add KeyPath [/v ValueName] [/t DataType] [/d DataValue] [/f]
   ```

   - `KeyPath`: The path to the registry key where you want to create the value.
   - `/v ValueName`: The name of the value to create.
   - `/t DataType`: The data type (e.g., REG_SZ for string, REG_DWORD for DWORD).
   - `/d DataValue`: The data to assign to the value.
   - `/f`: Forces overwriting without prompting.

3. **Example for Creating a New String Value**:
   ```powershell
   reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApp" /v Version /t REG_SZ /d "1.0" /f
   ```

4. **Syntax for Modifying an Existing Value**:
   ```powershell
   reg add KeyPath /v ValueName /t DataType /d DataValue
   ```

5. **Example for Modifying an Existing DWORD Value**:
   ```powershell
   reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApp" /v Version /t REG_DWORD /d 2
   ```

6. **Syntax for Deleting a Value**:
   ```powershell
   reg delete KeyPath /v ValueName [/f]
   ```

   - `/f`: Forces deletion without prompting.

7. **Example for Deleting a Value**:
   ```powershell
   reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApp" /v Version /f
   ```

8. **Backing Up and Restoring**:
   - You can export keys and values to a .reg file using the `reg export` command.
   - To import a .reg file, use the `reg import` command.

Using the Windows Registry Editor or command line tools (`reg`) allows you to create, modify, and delete registry values. Be cautious when editing the registry, as incorrect changes can affect system stability. Always back up the registry before making any edits, especially when using command line tools.
