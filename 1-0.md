# Conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal 

## 1. Understanding the Basics

- **Binary**: Base-2 system, uses only 0 and 1.
- **Decimal**: Base-10 system, uses digits from 0 to 9.
- **Hexadecimal**: Base-16 system, uses digits from 0 to 9 and letters A to F (where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15).

## 2. Conversion Methods

### Binary to Decimal:
- **Method**: Multiply each binary digit by 2 raised to its position number (starting from 0), and sum them up.
- **Example**: Binary `1101` → Decimal `13` (1x2^3 + 1x2^2 + 0x2^1 + 1x2^0 = 13).

### Decimal to Binary:
- **Method**: Divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainder. Repeat with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary number is the remainders read in reverse order.
- **Example**: Decimal `13` → Binary `1101`.

### Hexadecimal to Decimal:
- **Method**: Multiply each digit by 16 raised to its position number (starting from 0) and sum them up.
- **Example**: Hex `1D` → Decimal `29` (1x16^1 + Dx16^0 = 29, where D=13).

### Decimal to Hexadecimal:
- **Method**: Divide the decimal number by 16 and record the remainder. Repeat with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The hexadecimal number is the remainders read in reverse order, converting numbers above 9 to their hexadecimal letters.
- **Example**: Decimal `29` → Hex `1D`.

### Binary to Hexadecimal:
- **Method**: Group binary digits in sets of four (starting from the right), and convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent.
- **Example**: Binary `1101` → Hex `D`.

### Hexadecimal to Binary:
- **Method**: Convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-digit binary equivalent.
- **Example**: Hex `D` → Binary `1101`.

## 3. Practice Regularly
- Regular practice is key. Start with simple numbers and gradually increase the complexity.
- Use online converters to check your answers.

## 4. Visual Aids and Tools
- Create a conversion chart for quick reference.
- Use online tutorials and interactive exercises for more practice.

## 5. Understand the Logic
- Grasping why these conversions work as they do (e.g., understanding why we multiply by 2 or 16 in conversions) will deepen your understanding and make it easier to remember the methods.
