  - Real-time alerting and reporting.
- **Usage**: Deploy IDS sensors strategically within the network to detect and respond to suspicious activity.

## Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

### 3. Capabilities

- **Description**: IPS builds upon IDS by actively blocking or preventing detected threats in real-time.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Signature-based blocking of known threats.
  - Anomaly-based blocking of suspicious activity.
  - Integration with firewalls and routers.
- **Usage**: Place IPS devices at network chokepoints to proactively block malicious traffic.

## Firewall Solutions

### 4. Capabilities

- **Description**: Firewalls are a fundamental part of network security, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Stateful packet inspection.
  - Application-layer filtering.
  - Access control lists (ACLs).
  - VPN support for secure communication.
- **Usage**: Deploy firewalls at network boundaries to regulate traffic and enforce security policies.

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

### 5. Capabilities

- **Description**: EDR solutions provide advanced threat detection and response capabilities on individual endpoints.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Continuous monitoring of endpoint activity.
  - Behavioral analysis to identify threats.
  - Incident response and threat hunting features.
- **Usage**: Install EDR agents on endpoints to detect and respond to advanced threats.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

### 6. Capabilities

- **Description**: SIEM solutions collect, correlate, and analyze security data from various sources to identify threats.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Log aggregation from multiple devices and applications.
  - Real-time event correlation and alerting.
  - Incident investigation and reporting.
- **Usage**: Implement SIEM systems to centralize security monitoring and incident response.

## Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP)

### 7. Capabilities

- **Description**: EPP solutions provide comprehensive security for endpoints, combining antivirus, anti-malware, and other security features.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Multilayered protection against malware.
  - Behavioral analysis and sandboxing.
  - Device control and application whitelisting.
- **Usage**: Use EPP solutions to protect and manage endpoints across the organization.

## Email Security Gateways

### 8. Capabilities

- **Description**: Email security gateways protect against email-based threats, including phishing and malware.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Email filtering and threat detection.
  - Attachment and link analysis.
  - Encryption and data loss prevention (DLP).
- **Usage**: Deploy email security gateways to filter incoming and outgoing email traffic.

## Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

### 9. Capabilities

- **Description**: WAFs protect web applications from various online threats and attacks.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Web traffic filtering and inspection.
  - Protection against OWASP Top 10 threats.
  - Rate limiting and bot mitigation.
- **Usage**: Implement WAFs to secure web applications and APIs from cyberattacks.

## Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

### 10. Capabilities

- **Description**: SOAR platforms streamline security operations by automating repetitive tasks and facilitating incident response.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Incident workflow automation.
  - Integration with various security tools.
  - Threat intelligence correlation.
- **Usage**: Utilize SOAR platforms to improve incident response efficiency and coordination.
