  - Used for coordinated attacks, spam, or DDoS.

- **Example**: The "Mariposa" botnet, infecting millions of PCs.

## 9. **Keyloggers**

- **Key Features**:
  - Records keystrokes and user inputs.
  - Captures sensitive information.
  - Used for stealing credentials.

- **Example**: The "DarkTequila" keylogger, targeting financial data.

## 10. **Fileless Malware**

- **Key Features**:
  - Operates in memory without leaving traces.
  - Exploits legitimate system tools.
  - Eludes traditional antivirus.

- **Example**: The "PowerShell Empire" framework for fileless attacks.

## 11. **Mobile Malware (Mobile Apps and Devices)**

- **Key Features**:
  - Targets smartphones and tablets.
  - Steals data, sends SMS, or spies on users.
  - Distributed via malicious apps or phishing.

- **Example**: "Judy," an Android malware spreading through apps.

## 12. **Macro Malware (Microsoft Office Documents)**

- **Key Features**:
  - Embedded in macros within documents.
  - Activated when users enable macros.
  - Delivers payloads or downloads additional malware.

- **Example**: "Emotet," a banking Trojan often delivered via macros.

## 13. **IoT Malware (Internet of Things)**

- **Key Features**:
  - Targets IoT devices (e.g., cameras, routers).
  - Exploits vulnerabilities for control.
  - Contributes to botnets.

- **Example**: The "Mirai" botnet targeting IoT devices.

## 14. **Bootkits and MBR Malware**

- **Key Features**:
  - Infects Master Boot Record or boot sectors.
  - Executes before the OS loads.
  - Ensures persistence or bypasses security.

- **Example**: "Stoned" bootkit infecting MBRs.

## 15. **Memory-Resident Malware**

- **Key Features**:
  - Operates exclusively in system memory.
  - Eludes detection.
  - Executes various malicious functions.

- **Example**: "Sirefef" (ZeroAccess) rootkit residing in memory.

## 16. **Polymorphic Malware**

- **Key Features**:
  - Constantly changes its code or appearance.
  - Evades signature-based detection.


  - Adapts to environments and targets.

- **Example**: The "Storm Worm," known for its polymorphic nature.

## 17. **Multipartite Malware**

- **Key Features**:
  - Combines features of multiple malware types.
  - Highly versatile and challenging to combat.
  - Demands a comprehensive defense.

- **Example**: The "Tequila" multipartite malware.

## 18. **Armored Malware**

- **Key Features**:
  - Equipped with defensive mechanisms.
  - Uses encryption, obfuscation, and anti-analysis techniques.
  - Resistant to reverse engineering.

- **Example**: The "TDL-4" rootkit with strong anti-removal features.

## 19. **Zero-Day Exploits**

- **Key Features**:
  - Targets unknown vulnerabilities.
  - Used in highly targeted and stealthy attacks.
  - Can lead to data breaches and system compromise.

- **Example**: The "Stuxnet" worm, exploiting zero-day flaws in industrial systems.

Mastering these malware classes and their characteristics is vital for safeguarding systems against evolving threats in the cybersecurity landscape. Staying informed and employing robust security measures are essential for mitigating the risks posed by these malicious entities.
